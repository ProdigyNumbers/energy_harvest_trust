## Overview
This project is aimed at reducing crop burning and air pollution by: 
1. Identifying 
 - when & where farm waste is being burned
 - what and how much is getting burned
2. Intervening: by creating a marketplace for crop residue and connecting farmers, collectors and buyers of crop residue to provide better alternatives and reduce burning
3. Doing Policy advocacy: inform the government about areas where crop waste is getting burned and also, do advocacy for policy changes required for utilization of crop waste
