# Work Packages : 

This document outlines the work packages as described in the paper:
- [High resolution paddy rice maps in cloud-prone Bangladesh and Northeast India using Sentinel-1 data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0036-3)

and gives the plan for implementing the various work packages using Google Earth Engine for the region of Punjab in India.

## Requirements: 

- Cloud free Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 satellite
- Random Forest Classifier
- Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform

## Resources:

- Three distinct rice growing seasons in South Asia:
  - Boro (December / January to April)
  - Aus (April / May to June / July)
  - Aman (July / August to November)
- Validation of generated rice maps is carried out by comparing with existing product from the International Rice Research Institute and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.
